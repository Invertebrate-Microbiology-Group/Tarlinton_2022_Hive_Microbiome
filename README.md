This repository contains the code and documentation required to reproduce the 
results presented in our paper "16S Amplicon Metabarcoding from Nest Materials 
of Native Australian Stingless Bees". Beta diversity statistics describing 
microbiome variability associated with the different bee species and material 
types sampled are calculated, visualised, and used for hypothesis testing.

We describe how the raw metabarcoding datasets were processed using `QIIME 2` 
and further analysed in `R` to produce the figure included in our paper. This 
material is presented as a GitHub Pages site made with `Quarto`. An `renv` 
snapshot is provided to aid with reproducibility.
